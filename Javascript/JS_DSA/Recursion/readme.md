# Recursion
A breif introduction to recursion, This learning is based on udemy course of Colt Cteele's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures.

## Examples
- [countDown.js]()
- [sumRange.js]()
- [factorial.js]()
- [collectOddValues.js]()

### What is Call Stack?
A Call Stack is a data structure that keeps track of the function calls that are currently being made.
Example of Call Stack is in [callStack.js]()

### Difference between Recursion and Iteration?
- Recursion is a function that calls itself.
- Iteration doesn't call any function but it loops through different inputs.

### Pitfalls (means: danger or difficulty)
1. Not having a base case.
2. Not returning any value.
3. Returning a wrong value.

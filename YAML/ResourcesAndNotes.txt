YAML = YAML Aint Markup Language
- previously it was known as "Yet Another Markup Lnaguage"
 - reason for change in full form is Markup lang. stores documents but yaml stores documents as well as object data as well.

2: Online Yaml Tools (https://onlineyamltools.com/)

# Notes ðŸ“•
- yaml is case sensitive
- here ( ... ) means end of the file
- here ( --- ) means different documents
- file extention can be .yml or .yaml , both are same
- yaml can only store data and NOT commands
- Use Spaces for indentation, NOT Tabs

# Same Example in Yaml,Json,xml

# XML = Extensible Markup Language
<School name="IIT" principal="Ajay Sharma">
    <Students>
        <Student>
            <rno>01</rno>
            <name>"Vishwas Acharya"</name>
            <marks>90</marks>
        </Student>
    </Students>
</School>

# YAML = YAML Aint Markup Language

School:
 - name: IIT
   principal: Ajay Sharma
   Student:
    - rno: 01
      name: Vishwas Acharya
      marks: 90
...
  
# JSON = JavaScript Object Notion

[] represents collection

Example ðŸ‘‡
{
    "School": [
        {
            "name": "IIT",
            "principal": "Ajay Sharma",
            "Students": [
            {
